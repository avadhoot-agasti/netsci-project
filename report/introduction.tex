When try to install a python library or rather when we use this python 
library first thing that we need to do is we have to \textit{pip install} it.
More than often we run into an issue dependencies where its missing 
some dependency and when we install that dependency it complains 
for some other dependency and goes on till we install these dependencies.
Fundamentally, its missing some core dependencies as well. Why cant'
python bundle these core dependencies? But then how to identify those?
The python libraries keep growing so how to we identify which one needs
 to added/removed/updated etc? \newline
