\section{Requirements} \label{req}
The goal of this analysis is
 \begin{itemize}
 \item to create a network graph of these dependencies
 \item understand the dependencies and important nodes
 \item identify if its a scale-free network
 \item identify any other properties depicted by this graph
 \item update the graph and build the graph as and when needed
 \end{itemize}
 At the end of this exercise we should be able to run this
 analysis on available python \cite{www-python-org} packages.
 Also, we need to understand and compute the other properties of the graph
 like average degree, average clustering co-efficient, average path length etc
 Also verify if the graph is \textit{scale free} or just a \textit{random} graph.
