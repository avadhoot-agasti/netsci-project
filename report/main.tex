\begin{abstract}

The \textit{small world} phenomenon is a very important and interesting concept which can be practically 
used in optimizing imports for programming languages like python, java etc. This will also help us understand
the network of the packages used by developers and classify them as scale free or random network. Further,
this analysis can be extended to any other programming language and understand the package network. The 
scope of this project is to focus on python based packages and navigate to all dependent packages to build
a network graph of these packages. Further, identify the important packages which could be like important
nodes in scale-free network.
